# VisualizationMotionCaptureMoore

Here it uploaded the apps that helps to visualize the experimental data performed using motion capture of riders riding a bike on top of a treadmill during different conditions.

The apps available are: 

- GUI appVisualLite: Allows to see the bicycle and rider kinematics from the experimental data.

- GUI appVisualLite2: Allows to see the bicycle and rider kinematics from the experimental data, and the roll, yaw, and steer angle of the bike at the same time

- GUI appVisualModes2: Allows to see the modes of motion of the experimental data (bicycle and rider kinematics)


All document that process and generate the general coordinates and the motion modes of the system are presented in https://github.com/moorepants/MotionCapture

Download the data relative to the experiment realized by Moore in the following page: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Davis_Instrumented_Bicycle_Experiment_Raw_Data/1164632/1?file=1695306

See details of the data in runinfo and README.

# Notes

The apps where designed using the MATLAB extension appDesiner (made with matlab2024b). To run the program MATLAB has to be installed and the matlab address must be the same where the apps are located.

When the data is loaded in the apps by searching the files in the browser, make sure that the file has the '.mat' extension.
